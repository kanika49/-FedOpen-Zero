# 🧠 FedOpen-Zero: Federated Open-set and Continual Anomaly Detection Framework

> A Federated Learning framework for zero-day attack detection using Open-set Recognition, Continual Learning, and Blockchain validation.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**FedOpen-Zero** is a privacy-preserving, federated framework that detects **zero-day attacks** in IoT and vehicular networks.  
It combines **Anomaly Reconstruction**, **Open-set Recognition (OSR)**, and **Robust Federated Learning** with **Blockchain-based validation** to provide secure, explainable, and adaptive intrusion detection.
